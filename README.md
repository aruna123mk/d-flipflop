Flip flops are the devices that store the data in them, that is either 1 or 0.
D flip flop is also the one type that has d, clk, and reset as inputs,q, and qbar are the outputs as shown in the diagram below. The specialty of this d flip-flop is it gives the output whatever it takes as input.

As shown in the above diagram we can see that the data is stored in the flip-flop when only the clock arises and it will not store the data when the clock goes negative.
